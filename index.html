        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I'm Ethan Stuart, a dedicated business intelligence professional and product management professional with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable business strategies. Currently, as the Manager of Business Intelligence at Yum! Brands - Taco Bell Corporate, I lead a dynamic team of engineers and BI analysts. In this role, I take pride in overseeing the intricate tapestry of customer data, ensuring its alignment with project management goals. My expertise lies in enhancing stakeholder engagement, refining product roadmaps, and championing agile methodologies that optimize workflow and foster seamless communication across departments.</p>
    
        <p>Previously, at Capital Group, I wore the hat of a Data Product Manager, where I steered multiple data products that bolstered the marketing and sales endeavors of the North America Client Group. A hallmark achievement during this tenure was the inception and management of a functional data lineage database within PowerBI. This tool illuminated the data lineage for each data point across various channels and asset classes, acting as a pivotal resource for the team.</p>
    
        <p>My time at Sprout Mortgage further honed my BI skills. Here, I leveraged advanced Power BI techniques to craft interactive reports, integrating data from disparate sources. I took the helm, under the guidance of the SVP of Business Intelligence, to dispense insights pivotal to business decision-making. In addition, I spearheaded initiatives to systematically empower sales leaders with processes that accelerated business growth through strategic client engagement and targeted acquisition strategies.</p>
    
        <p>My dedication to continuous learning is unwavering. I hold a B.B.A. in Finance and Economics from Loyola Marymount University and have consistently augmented my skill set with a series of certifications. Notably, I've completed a comprehensive suite of courses from Coursera's Google Project Management series and have honed my technical prowess with certifications from HackerRank in SQL and Python.</p>
    
        <p>Technically proficient in tools like SQL, Python, Confluence, Jira, Alteryx, Tableau, and PowerBI, I pride myself on my ability to stay at the forefront of technological advancements. My expertise spans project and product management, corporate strategy, agile frameworks, and BI, and I have a particular knack for crafting compelling presentations suitable for all levels of an organization.</p>
    
        <p>In essence, I am a lifelong learner and problem solver, always eager to expand my horizons and bring innovative solutions to the table. My career trajectory underscores a blend of leveraging data for business growth, mastering operational efficiencies, and leading teams to unparalleled success, all while keeping an eye on the ever-evolving landscape of technology and data.</p>
